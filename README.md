# Employee Tracker Using MySQL

## Description
I was tasked with creating an Employee Tracker CLI application for building and maintaining a company's employee database. Built on MySQL and leveraging modularity in the structure of the Employee Tracker, it can scale appropriately with a companies growth without reconfiguring the core structure of the internal employee database. This application is meant to be a foundation that can be built upon throughout the growth of the business. This Employee Tracker application allows managers or other staff within the company to view all employees, roles, as well as departments. It also allows for adding employees, roles, departments and updating employees all from the CLI.
